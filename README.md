# Hello There!, I'm Ritik Prajapati! 👋


I’m a React Native developer focused on building fast, reliable, and meaningful mobile experiences. I specialize in architecting scalable app structures, crafting pixel-perfect UIs and delivering features that feel intuitive and effortless to users. With hands-on experience across React Native, Node.js, Expo, offline-first design, and performance optimization, I enjoy turning ideas into production-ready apps that solve real problems.
